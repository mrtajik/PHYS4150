Exercise 4.4: Calculating integrals

a)  Write a program to evaluate the integral above with N = 100 and compare the
result with the exact value. The two will not agree very well, because N = 100 
is not a sufficiently large number of slices.
b)  Increase the value of N to get a more accurate value for the integral. If 
we require that the program runs in about one second or less, how accurate a 
value can you get?

Solution
Part a)
Part b)
