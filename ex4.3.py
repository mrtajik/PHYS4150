Exercise 4.3: Calculating derivatives

a)  Write a program that defines a function f(x) returning the value x(x−1), 
then calculates the derivative of the function at the point x = 1 using the 
formula above with δ = 1e−2. Calculate the true value of the same derivative 
analytically and compare with the answer your program gives. 
The two will not agree perfectly. Why not?

b)  Repeat the calculation for δ =1e−4, 1e−6, 1e−8, 1e−10, 1e−12, and 1e−14. 
You should see that the accuracy of the calculation initially gets better as δ
gets smaller, but then gets worse again. Plot your result as a function of δ.
Why is this?
